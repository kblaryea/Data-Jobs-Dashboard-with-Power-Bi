## Data Jobs Dashboard w/ Power Bi

### Introduction

This dashboard was developed to support job seekers, career transitioners, and professionals exploring new opportunities by addressing a common challenge: the scattered and often difficult-to-interpret nature of data job market information. Utilizing a real-world dataset of 2024 data science job postings—including job titles, salary ranges, and geographic locations—the project offers a consolidated, user-friendly interface to analyze market trends and compensation patterns.
